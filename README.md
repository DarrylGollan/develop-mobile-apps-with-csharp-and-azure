# Develop Cloud Connected Mobile Apps with Xamarin and Microsoft Azure

Thank you for your interest in my book.  I have moved (or am in the process of moving) all my repositories to GitLab, as I like an independent source code repository (and I pay for that).

Please point your browser at the following:

* The site is at https://adrianhall.gitlab.io/develop-mobile-apps-with-csharp-and-azure/
* The repository is at https://gitlab.com/adrianhall/develop-mobile-apps-with-csharp-and-azure 

One of the great things about the new GitLab is that CI/CD is included, so the site is updated automatically when I merge.  Feel free to do a pull request over there!
